***About Cozy home***

Cozy home is specialized in Expats rentals. Their clients are companies searching to relocate their expat. Their landlords are also often people leaving for expatriation, that never come back to their initial house and at one point they go through Cozy home to sell their properties.

“It’s always the same story. The family just did tons of construction work on their house, get a contract to leave in 6 months in expat, they say yes, leave for the first 3 years, then go elsewhere. At start they always think they will come back to their house, but in fact they don’t. “ “En fait, tu ne reviens pas en arrière”. 

Important sell for Andrea are 1.2 M€ properties, where she can make a 40-50k€ fee. 

***Andrea challenges***

- What she thinks it’s very important is to manage your client from A to Z. Before, they tried to split the work between the guys who is finding the mandate, the guy who is doing the visits. It didn’t work. The same person needs to satisfy the client’s need from the start till the end.
- On Supply and demand
    - There is a high seasonality in this expat market. So having a property in in november may take a few months to be rented. Expat usually start in september or January.
    - The furnished rental is a niche market
    - Average rental time is 2 to 3 years, same for their niche market for expat than others

***About the process***

- Usually the process is done in 1 meeting on the landlord side.
- To rent an apartment, it can then take further visits. Their role is to try to find the best candidates for any appartment. They usually work with mobility person from HR.
- The pictures are really important for them, as expat usually spend 2 days at the end of their discovery trip to the city they will go to select where they will leave. So pictures help them pre-select the properties they will visit.
- Usually once a landlord is in the agency they stay. They out because they sell the property.

***About pictures***

- Andrea coaches her commercials to take good pictures. They need to set the place before shooting
    - Get the pillows right on the bed
    - Close toilet basin
    - Remove the dishwashing liquid
- Then try to take good pictures
    - Use wide angle
    - Get perspective
    - Open Windows
- Take a video with a flow that is the most simple possible.
    - Position the camera at the center of the body
    - Open the window
    - Make the tour of each room as if you were visiting the appartment and it works.
- She may take a photographer
    - When the rental is above 3k€ a month
    - When she sells a property (and it depends on her fee)
    - She works with Immoz for that and really like their service.
- Frequency : They take picture in between rentals, as the landlord may have done embellishment work in between 2 rentals, change and buy new furnitures
- Then, she provides a basic coaching on photoshop
    - Redimension the picture to the adequate format & weight for Seloger & Explorimmo
    - They pre-saved functions on Photoshop to make it easier
    - They manage the light
    - They add their watermark
- On virtual visit
    - It’s pretty expensive for it brings - Don’t do it
    - A diagnostic person lastly offered her to do it.
- On home staging
    - Virtual: They can not do that and absolutely don’t want to do it as people need to project into the property.
    - Real ones: if a veranda is not as clean as it should and they need a specific cleaning, rarely happens
- Pictures as reinsurance - The first thing the landlord see from you, when they have just selected you is the pictures. So if your pictures are great, it will immediately set the tone for the rest of the relationship. If you provide great pictures, they will think they have chosen the good agency.

***About the CRM***

- Crypto. Very satisfied about it. (not sure about the name).

***About the listing***

- Text is important. 1st sentence must be catchy. Takes 20 min to create for a property to sell, 5 min for a rental.

***About Innovation***

- The society is really changing and having a property is not such a big thing anymore “avoir une résidence principale”. People tend to move. They don’t care of furnitures. “Who really wants to buy a 3K€ table today ?” Airbnb makes us used to having the same furnitures everywhere in the world. and we don’t care. We just want something where we can feel ok, as the quality of life is one of the most important things now. “Moins d’attache” “tiers lieux” et “immobilier d’interieur”.
- What will develop is the ability to lean the process to buy a property as if you were buying a simple consumption good. With less affect and less time to think. “Rendre tout cela plus simple”. No need of the 15 rational visits anymore.
- And a lot of that will be investment. I want a financial performance that is above other investments I can be doing.
