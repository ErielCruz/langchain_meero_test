# User Feedback

***About Benoit***

Benoit is a parent at Alix’ children s school. Benoit is THE realtor from Veyrier du Lac. His parents were there before him, and the independant agency has been created more than 40 years ago

He has 2 partners “associés”, 1 “salary” salarié & 1 “alternant”. 

He sells 70 properties per year. 

Benoit is a very serious trailer, his answers were pretty direct and straight to the point. 

***On the group*** 

Benoit is affiliated to Christies - “But they are not shareholders”. He pays a fee “redevance”, and it helps for “reinsurance” when it takes mandates “from people coming from Paris”. I don’t want anything more from them. “J’attends rien de plus”. 

**Benoit was the meeting before us in an Christies affiliate meeting when for the first time he heard about Exposio. They were saying the tool is great but also very cheap with 60 cts per picture.** 

***On the challenges***

- Get in mandates. There is no supply and a very large demand. “Buyers, I have tons of them”.
- About demand contraction. With the interest rates increase, from 1 to 4%, it’s an increase of 25% in monthly mortgage so we begin to feel it since the strat of the year. They are now offer that are way below the price, which didn’t happen before;

***On the process***

See landlords once or twice. 
First visit
Then sometimes for estimation feedback. 
Then mandates are all signed electronically. 

***On the shooting***

Benoit doesn’t go to the shooting. He works with a bunch of photographer and one in particularly, who lives in Annecy. 
He is fast & efficient. Timing is not a challenge. Budget is usually 400 to 500€. Global budget for the year is 30k€. 

The shooting is decided when a landlord say go to Benoit. He usually trust people and doesn’t wait for the mandate to be electronically signed. 
Sometimes he takes 1 or 2 pictures when he exactly know to whom he would sell this property

The photographer takes pictures, delivered, add the watermarking, does the virtual visit with Matterport. 

Usually pictures are taken with furnitures. People are still leaving within their house. It’s pretty rare to have no furnitures house, except when it’s a “succession”. 

***CRM***

CRM is AppImmo. He is very satisfied with it. “Très facile, très content”. Before he did the wrong choice between AppImmo and the other competitor he doesn’t remember the name. 

It cost him 200-250€ per user per month. 

He still needs to publish listings, via CRM that goes directly to Se Loger or Explorimmo. 

***Visual elements & listings***

- Floor plans
    - Doesn’t make so much sense for an old house.
    - It’s indeed totally different for appartments
    - He has the option to pay 15€ more per property with the photographer. Needs 24h so “its’ probably some guys in india doing it”. He does it sometimes
    - He takes them for new house, programs but never published them.
- Listing
    - On the time spend on listing “I love to write”. But I keep it very simple & neutral. He has once in 2017 someone complaining the text was not at the level of the house “le texte n’est pas à la hauteur de la maison”.
    - Says there are 2 schools there : very long & poetry or very sharp and to the point
- Virtual visit - Early adopter of Matterport machine - First adopter in France
    - He was the first one to have the matterport machine. It was a geek coming to Bourguoin Jallieu entering his agency, completely passionated about that. Says I bought that but it’s no use for me. I think it could be for you. I let the machine 1 month. It costs only 5k€, so he bought it
    - Right now, it’s a must have “c’est indispensable”.
- Video
    - He now does a video on top of the pictures. He tried with drone too, especially to see the environement - Mountain in Veyrier, sky resort in La Clusaz

How does he sees the next innovations in RE ?

- Probably AR. He saw it in a NYC flat. He went to the terrace and saw he really had vertigo!

# Interviewer Observations

- Luxury selling seems to have similar path with Olivia
- Price of Exposio - 60 cts - Christies ‘s affiliates are still interested in
