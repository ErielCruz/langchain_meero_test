# User Feedback

**About Isabelle**

- Isabelle (in her 45-50yo) and lives in La Vienne.
- She has joined Efficity lastly at the end of 2022.
- Before that, she was selling swimming pool for more than 17 years
- An Efficity “coach” has “recruited her to become a realtor, and she sees a lot of similitudes with her past job in swimming pools. The “coach” works in a pyramid way - coach gets money if she sells a property.
- Her coach is doing that for the last 8-9 years.
- She is at a start of a new career, on a new business, new region, new boyfriend
- At Efficity, they are independant. Isabelle is an auto entrepreneur for now, still benefits from unemployement money and knows it’s not a challenge if she takes 6 months to sell her property. She has 18 months in front of her to make it work or not. She has not “mauvaise pression”.
- She considers herself in training. She doesn’t handle the whole process for now. As she never sold 1 property.

***About Efficity***

- There is not a company spirit “esprit d’équipe” at Efficity. The coach has organised a meeting, but everyone pays his own transport so not so many people came.
- They are creating Effyboost : a meeting for the less than 1 year comers, at 3hours max of driving

***Finding her mandates***

- As she starts, she is doing “piges” on “Le Bon Coin” to source her properties

***About the process***

- Isabelle usually do one meeting for everything. People let her do. She explains them she is trying her best to make their listing as attractive as possible.
- For photo-taking picture, her coach gave her advice
    - 2 walls max, 1 angle
    - No artificial light
    - Open the window
    - Not too many angle
    - Natural “ambiance”
    - Not to high, not too low
- On the listing
    - Writing the listing is not a challenge , “I like to write - J’aime rédiger, faire une vraie phrase, je vais refaire tant que je n’ai pas la bonne mouture”.
    - She is taking notes during her visit about the features and details she wants to appear in the listing

***Going Beyond pictures***

- Never did virtual visit - “Could be interesting for potential buyers that can not come to visit the property”.
- Plan : “we have an app for that”.

***What she likes in our app***

- Before / After
- Grey sky becomes blue
- There is a real difference
- She tries once and then was convinced she needed our app.
- Her first mandate was coming from Le Bon Coin and the landlord already did some pictures. The landlord was a jurist. And she was really amazed by the quality of the pictures taken by Isabelle thanks to Realtors “très jolies photos”, “qui donnent envie”.  That’s also why buying the app was an evidence.
- She was on test users, received notifications. She wanted to take the subscription to be “comfortable”.

***How she uses our app***

- she takes Twice more pictures as she needs it
- At the end, she uploads between 6 -15 pictures
- She is creating 1 picture per album and would like to have a training as she is not sure she uses the app properly
- She is sharing pictures to her email, then download the pictures. Then creates her listing on Efficity CRM.

Feature requests

# Interviewer Observations
